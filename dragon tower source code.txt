It’s an exciting game offering a super straightforward gameplay experience, giving you a chance to progress through the game while unlocking some big multipliers along the way.</p><p>It’s one of a number of popular games by Stake, alongside the likes of <a href=\"https://stake.us/casino/games/limbo\">Limbo</a>, <a href=\"https://stake.us/casino/games/hilo\">Hilo</a>, <a href=\"https://stake.us/casino/games/mines\">Mines</a>, <a href=\"https://stake.us/casino/games/crash\">Crash</a>, <a href=\"https://stake.us/casino/games/keno\">Keno</a>, and <a href=\"https://stake.us/casino/games/wheel\">Wheel</a>, all of which are available right now at <a href=\"https://stake.us/casino/home\">Stake social casino.</a></p><h2>How to Play Dragon Tower Online at Stake</h2><p>The first thing to decide before playing Dragon Tower is how much you would like to play per game.</p><p>The game is unique in many respects, and you can even set the level of difficulty for the gameplay, choosing easy, medium, hard, expert, or master.</p><p>The aim of the game is to guess which tiles in each row the dragon eggs will appear. If you guess correctly, you can earn an instant win or move up to the next level, unlocking multipliers as you go.</p><p>You can pick the boxes yourself or activate the auto-pick feature to do it for you.</p><p>To learn more about how to play, read on or check out our extensive <a href=\"https://stake.us/blog/how-to-play-dragon-tower-on-stake\">Dragon Tower game guide</a>!</p><h2>What are the Basic Rules of Dragon Tower?</h2><p>Dragon Tower takes place across a grid with individual tiles. The size of the grid (linked to the game’s difficulty level) determines how many tiles are in play at any given time.</p><p>As well as fewer boxes, the more advanced levels come with bigger multipliers that are added to your wins as you progress up the tower towards the dragon.</p><p>Each time you click on a segment to reveal a dragon egg, you move up a level and unlock a higher multiplier. You are then given a chance to end the game.</p><p>If you proceed and fail to reveal a dragon egg with your next selection, you will lose the multiplier and return to zero.</p><h2>Dragon Tower Playing Options, RTP &amp; House Edge</h2><p>Dragon Tower is a provably fair game with a unique gameplay experience. You can decide which difficulty level to play this game on – easy, medium, hard, expert, or master. After setting the difficulty level, you can choose how much to play each time you select a segment.</p><p>Dragon Tower offers multipliers that increase each time you move up a line on the game grid. As mentioned, the higher the difficulty, the higher the multipliers offered.</p><p>This game has a theoretical return to player percentage of 98%, meaning that the Dragon Tower house edge is just 2%.</p><h2>Dragon Tower Strategies &amp; Tips</h2><p>Dragon Tower is a social casino game that offers you the chance to set the difficulty level, giving you more control as you play. Before getting started, here are some tips and tricks to consider:</p><ul><li>Dragon Tower is a provably fair game of luck, and strategy will only take you so far. Be mindful that you can win and lose in this game in equal measure.</li><li>Study the game rules and understand the difficulty levels before deciding on the amount you play with.</li><li>The option to opt-out is the most important feature in Dragon Tower – deciding when to stop playing and when to go for the next multiplier is hugely important and can make or break your strategy.</li><li>The more Stake Original games you play at Stake.us, the more you can earn as part of our <a href=\"https://stake.us/vip-club\">VIP club</a>.
